# kde-plasma-adaptive-wallpaper-accent-color
This is a simple tool for automatically changing accent color based on wallpaper for kde plasma.
# How to use
First make sure you have the accent color option in system setting. Without this the tool can't work. AFter this select the option to pick an accent. 
You don't need to select a custom accent color. Any predefined accent color will work. After setting any accent color the tool will be able to work and 
you don't need to worry about accent color anymore. It will be generated from wallpaper automatically and will be applied. To start the tool follow the 
steps described below. ( I can omit this step but that will need plasma 5.24 but I don't want to exclue 5.23 users). You must have image or slideshow
as wallpaper plugin for this tool to work. Other plugins are not supported.

After download is done copy the program and put it in the auto start folder. After this reboot. If the tool doesn't auto start then 
you can also start it manually at each start up or just write a shell script to launch it on start up.
